# Question
#Since you've mastered basic input/output and variables, let's add conditional statements to the mix!

#Goal: Create a program that asks for the user's birth year and calculates their age, then tells them if they're a minor or an adult.

current_year = 2024

birth_year = int(input('what is your birth_year '))

age = current_year-birth_year

if age >= 18 :
         print('You are an aldut')
else :
        print('You are a minor')




# Assignment 2 
#Create a program that asks for the user's birth year AND current year, then provides more detailed age categorization.

# solution .

#birth_year = input(int('what is your birth_year'))

#current_year = input(int('whatis your current_year'))
